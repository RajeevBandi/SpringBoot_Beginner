# Guidelines to Prepare DAOs:

1. **Define DAO Interfaces Clearly**
   - **Single Responsibility:** Each DAO interface should handle operations related to a specific entity.
   - **CRUD Operations:** Typically, a DAO interface should include methods for basic CRUD operations: create, read, update, and delete.

2. **Implement DAO Classes Efficiently**
   - **Use Springâ€™s JdbcTemplate:** Leverage Spring's `JdbcTemplate` or other Spring abstractions to reduce boilerplate code and handle common tasks like connection management, exception handling, and resource cleanup.
   - **RowMapper:** Create a `RowMapper` to map database rows to Java objects. This can be done as a separate class or an inner class, depending on its usage.
   - **Transactions:** Use Spring's transaction management to ensure data consistency and handle transaction boundaries. Annotate service methods with `@Transactional` where needed.

3. **Handle Exceptions Appropriately**
   - **Exception Translation:** Use Spring's `DataAccessException` hierarchy to handle exceptions. This provides a consistent way to handle database errors and translate them into runtime exceptions.

4. **Optimize Performance**
   - **Batch Operations:** For bulk insert, update, or delete operations, use batch processing to improve performance.

5. **Document DAO Methods**
   - **Documentation:** Clearly document each DAO method with comments describing its purpose, parameters, and return values. This improves code readability and maintainability.

6. **Encapsulate Data Access Logic**
   - **Hide SQL Details:** DAOs should encapsulate all SQL-related details. The rest of the application should interact with DAOs without knowing the specifics of the SQL queries.

7. **Unit Testing**
   - **Test Coverage:** Write unit tests for DAO methods to ensure they work as expected. Use in-memory databases or mock the database interactions for testing.

8. **Avoid Business Logic in DAOs**
   - **Separation of Concerns:** DAOs should only handle data access and not business logic. Business logic should reside in service classes.

9. **Consider SQL Injection Prevention**
   - **Use Prepared Statements:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid SQL injection attacks.
