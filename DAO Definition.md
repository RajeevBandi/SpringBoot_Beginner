# DAO Definition:

DAO stands for Data Access Object. It is a design pattern used to abstract and encapsulate all interactions with a data source, such as a database. The DAO pattern provides a layer of abstraction between the business logic and the data source, facilitating easier management, testing, and maintenance of data access logic.

The DAO pattern is crucial for managing data access in an application. By defining a clear separation between the data access logic and the rest of the application, it enhances maintainability, flexibility, and testability. In a Spring application, DAOs are typically implemented using interfaces and concrete classes, with frameworks like JDBC, JPA, or Hibernate providing the actual data access logic.
