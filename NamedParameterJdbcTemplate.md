# NamedParameterJdbcTemplate

`NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` is an extension of `JdbcTemplate` provided by Spring. It offers a more flexible and readable way to work with SQL queries by allowing the use of named parameters instead of traditional positional parameters. Named parameters improve code readability and help avoid mistakes related to the order of parameters in SQL queries.

### Key Features

- **Named Parameters:** Instead of using positional placeholders (e.g., `?`), you can use named parameters (e.g., `:paramName`). This makes SQL queries more readable and easier to understand.
- **Improved Readability:** Named parameters help in clearly identifying what each parameter represents, which can be particularly useful in complex queries.
- **Flexibility:** Allows for more flexible and dynamic query construction.
