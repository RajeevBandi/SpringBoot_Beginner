# SimpleJdbcTemplate

The `SimpleJdbcTemplate` class was deprecated in Spring 3.1 and eventually removed in later versions. The main reason for this deprecation was to consolidate functionality into the more widely used `JdbcTemplate` and `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` classes. 

### Key Points

- **Deprecation:** `SimpleJdbcTemplate` was deprecated in Spring 3.1 and removed in later versions.
- **Reason:** The deprecation was due to the consolidation of its functionality into `JdbcTemplate` and `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate`.
- **Java 5 Features:** `SimpleJdbcTemplate` was initially introduced to take advantage of Java 5 features like generics and varargs.
- **Redundancy:** As these Java 5 features were integrated into the core `JdbcTemplate` classes, `SimpleJdbcTemplate` became redundant.
