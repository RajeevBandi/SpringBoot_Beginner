## What is MyBatis?

MyBatis is a persistence framework that automates the mapping between SQL databases and Java objects. It simplifies database access by allowing developers to write SQL directly and map the results to Java objects without needing extensive boilerplate code.

## Features of MyBatis

### 1. **Custom SQL Support**
- Write raw SQL queries for precise control over database operations.
- No hidden or auto-generated SQL; you have full visibility.

### 2. **Object Mapping**
- Automatically maps query results to Java objects and vice versa.
- Supports complex mappings using annotations or XML configuration.

### 3. **Dynamic SQL**
- Dynamically generate SQL queries based on conditions using:
  - `if`
  - `choose`
  - `foreach`

### 4. **Lightweight**
- No need for heavy configurations or runtime libraries compared to full ORM frameworks like Hibernate.

### 5. **Integration**
- Seamlessly integrates with frameworks like Spring, enabling dependency injection for SQL sessions.

### 6. **Cache Support**
- Built-in support for:
  - **First-Level Cache** (session-level).
  - **Second-Level Cache** (application-level).

### 7. **Database Independence**
- Supports multiple database dialects without requiring major code changes.

### 8. **Ease of Testing**
- Works well with mocking frameworks due to its decoupled architecture.
- Allows for easy testing of mappers and services.

## Advantages of MyBatis

1. Fine-grained control over SQL queries.
2. Minimal overhead compared to ORMs like Hibernate.
3. Easy integration with other frameworks like Spring.
4. Flexible mappings, supporting complex result sets.
5. Dynamic SQL generation reduces hardcoding and makes queries reusable.

## Disadvantages of MyBatis

1. Requires manual management of SQL and mappings, which can increase maintenance for large projects.
2. Complex queries can become harder to maintain compared to the abstraction provided by ORMs.
3. No built-in support for managing database relationships, requiring developers to handle joins and associations.
